# rocket-dude
2D space shooter with a complete disregard for efficiency and realism

Instructions for how to get this running mostly for myself in the future for when I inevitably forget how this works, but also for anyone who wants to try it

1) Get Qt (the open source version)
https://www.qt.io/download

2) Open rocketDude2.pro in Qt creator

3) Click the play button in the lower left corner
